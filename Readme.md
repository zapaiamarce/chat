# Motivations

Next.js is an awesome platform to create React based apps. It includes almost everything and let me thing in my components structure and use some basics dependencies to build complex apps. The default SSR feature of next offer a super high performance app just out of the box. I added module-resolver plugin for babel in order to write more readeable dependencies and make the entire structure more scalable.
Styled components let me to create a string ui layer and compose complex and scalable components.

# What would i do different with more time

- Work more in the ui layer/theme just to create a more solid base
- Work more in the chat components in order to extract some hooks in a reusable ones
- Use a image cdn like cloudinary for images
- Optimize the google font load
- split some non critical components using dynamic import
- check SEO
